1. Reduce regions to lines and lines to words.join() → fragments
2. Sort fragments by y-value
3. Group fragments by similar y-value
4. Within such groups, order by x-value
5. Look for main cast and pick them out.
6. Among the main cast, calculate the (average) line spacing.
7. Find the major headings (Tanzsolisten, Gesangssolisten, …)
8. For all fragment groups, assign them to a heading by checking
    a. that their y-value is higher than that of the heading
    b. after the first row they have more or less the average line space distance
9. Parse assigned fragemnt groups into names.


TODO:
- remove .,/\ form names
- doesn't deal with Munich screen layout (next to each other)
- idea: check if main cast roles / names are always two regions
    → if so, use region distance and then exclude them
    → if ensemble is always their own region only process that one

CONSTRAINTS:
- Regions are instable both in size and number.
- Not all headings can always be found.
- It is known which headings contain how many persons.
